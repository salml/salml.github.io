I'm a DC-based data scientist at Elder Research, a data science consultancy that delivers custom machine learning solutions and provides training to clients in the both the public and private sectors. Since joining the team in 2018, my projects have spanned a wide variety of techniques and technology, helping me narrow my interest a _tiny_ bit to applications of deep learning to remote sensing data. I'm talking drones, sensors, satellites, all of it. Especially in precision agriculture. I have this vision of myself where I live on a small plot of land at the center of a bunch of farms, and I have a massive drone launch pad that I use to perform flyovers of everyone's crops on a daily basis. Then I build epic models to make more food with less pesticides (and more deep learning). And I would definitely get a couple of doggos...maybe this should be a future blog post? Stay tuned!

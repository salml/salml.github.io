When I get a break from client work, I lead a small team of data scientists focused on applications of deep learning for accelerated disaster response. Currently, we're building models to localize and assess building damage with satellite imagery from before and after natural disasters. The [dataset](http://xview2.org/) spans over 45k sq km of imagery with 6 disaster types and over 850k building polygons labeled according to the Joint Damage Scale, an ordinal scale for assessing building damage. Our work is focused on finding the best way to leverage data across disasters through domain adaptation, and we suspect that explicitly modeling domain shift across locations and disaster types will lead to higher performing models.
